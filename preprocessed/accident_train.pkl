bulletin to replace existing nozzle locks with ones that had thicker posts and arms.ró?  U|there were two previously reported failures of sb 72-1082 lpt nozzle locks discovered during routine under-cowl inspections.rò?  Uxin march 1994 the manufacturer issued another service bulletin sb 72-1082 which introduced a newly designed nozzle lock.rô?  U¶an examination of a cracked 2nd stage nozzle lock from a comparison engine also revealed oxidation and intergranular fracture features consistent with stress rupture.rö?  U¬the new locks which were installed on the accident engine utilized original diameter stud shanks but were manufactured from a different material and did not require modification of the lpt case.rõ?  Uethe nozzle segments had rotated 120 degrees within the lpt case but the case itself was not breached.rú?  Uäaccording to the engine manufacturer the failures were intergranular suggesting either stress rupture or sustained peak low cycle
