furthermore the instructor said that training as they had at the air carrier airport most flights involved wake turbulence avoidance .
while the solo student pilot of the cessna 152 was on downwind leg for landing the air traffic controller directed the student 's attention to a boeing 757 aircraft that t was preceding the student 's aircraft for landing on the parallel runway .
the safety board prepared a study of wake turbulence encounter using data from the boeing 757 's flight data recorder tower communication tapes and tower reported surface winds .
the student 's flight instructor told the safety board that the student who t had 136 hours of dual instruction and 20 hours of solo flight time had received instruction in wake turbulence avoidance at three points in ground instruction .
the report concluded that the cessna 152 descended into the boeing 757 's wake when the wake was 37 to 41 seconds old .
the controller then advised of a 10-knot quartering headwind from the right issued a wake turbulence precaution and cleared the student pilot for the landing option .
witnesses reported that as the student pilot was on final approach descending through approximately 100-foot altitude agl the aircraft abruptly rolled inverted and crashed short of the runway threshold .
the threshold of the parallel runway is abeam and 500 feet to the right of the runway the student was to land on .
