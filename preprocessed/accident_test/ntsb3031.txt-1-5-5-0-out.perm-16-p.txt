the aircraft tit gauge which had been miscalibrated by 30 to 40 degrees when the airplane was manufactured was found to indicate 110 degrees fahrenheit low near the maximum continuous point of 1,750 degrees .
the flight was vectored to a nearby airport but the pilot flew toward another airport and crashed in a residential area .
examination of the engine revealed 1.8 quarts of oil were drained and 3 of the 6 connecting rods were failed due to lack of lubrication .
also detonation damage to the number 6 cylinder piston was noted and scoring of piston sidewalls was noted at 5 of the 6 cylinders .
the air/oil separator hose to the scavenge pump was plugged about 10 inches along length with a substance with a high lead content resulting in the recurring pilot report of excessive oil consumption .
during cruise flight at 14,000 feet mean sea level the engine failed .
evidence of heat discoloration was noted to the connecting rod journals for 3 of the 6 cylinders .
about 1 month before the accident one of the cylinder pistons was removed and replaced after examination revealed piston sidewall damage consistent with detonation .
due to the pilot complaint of excessive oil consumption 4 of the 6 cylinders were removed and replaced within the previous 6 months .
