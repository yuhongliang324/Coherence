when the accident airplane was about 20 feet above the ground it suddenly rolled right faster than a full application of aileron could counteract and the right wing contacted the ground .
witness statements place the uh-60 100 to 600 feet away from the accident airplane at the time of the accident .
with a fight instructor the pilot executed a normal takeoff from runway 34 for right closed traffic .
because a uh-60 helicopter was executing an approach from the southwest to the threshold of runway 34 the pilot extend the touchdown point by 1,000 feet .
according to the aeronautical information manual every aircraft generates vortices that can cause an uncommanded roll that exceeds the roll-control authority of the encountering airplane .
the helicopter transitioned to hovering flight near the threshold about 30 seconds before the accident airplane .
landing helicopters produce a pair of strong high-speed trailing vortices similar to larger fixed wing aircraft .
after a short delay the uh-60 air-taxied to the ramp .
pilots of small aircraft should use caution when operating behind landing helicopters .
