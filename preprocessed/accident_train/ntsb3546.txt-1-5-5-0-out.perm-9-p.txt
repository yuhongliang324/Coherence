the pilot-in-command pic had just maneuvered the bell 212 helicopter into a 100 foot hover above a small reservoir to fill a ' bambi ' bucket for fire-fighting operations .
this in turn increased the angle of the long line from the vertical or zero degree reference .
the rotorcraft began to settle .
the shearing of the flight idle stop resulted in a restriction/cessation of fuel flow to the 1 engine fuel control unit and subsequent engine shutdown .
he then executed a single-engine autorotation during which a rotor blade impacted a dead tree .
the pic perceiving that he had encountered rotor vortex conditions slipped the helicopter to the right with the bucket still in the reservoir .
immediately thereafter the pic noted a loss of power in the 1 engine .
