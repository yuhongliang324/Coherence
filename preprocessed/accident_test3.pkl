.qeU§the airplane 's right wing struck a 25-foot-high pole at the edge of an open field about 12 feet above the ground and 900 feet from the approach end on the runway .qfU≤the private pilot stated that during the approach he thought that they were getting ' too slow and too low and when full power was applied the engine response ' sounded strange .qgUUexamination of the wreckage revealed no preimpact failure of the airframe or engine .qhUôwhile operating in clouds at flight level 290 in an area with thunderstorms and turbulence the airplane experienced a loss of power in all four engines .qiUÄinformation from the flight data recorder indicated that during descent from flight level 290 an elevator oscillation occurred .qjUIthe 1 and 2 engines were shut down due to high turbine gas temperatures .qkUYthe 2 engine was restarted before making an emergency landing at the des moines airport .qlUTthe captain reported that the airplane had been flown into severe icing conditions .qmUzthe aircraft flight manual afm prohibited flight in icing conditions above 26,000 feet except when necessary for descent .qnU–also the afm stipulated the minimum engine speeds which needed to be maintained while operating in icing conditions it also required that the thrust management system tms be disconnected in icing conditions .qoUethere were indications that the tms was disconnected about 230 seconds after engine roll-back began .qpUãadditionally the afm did not provide accurate information concerning in cloud ' correction factor for the outside temperature thermometer .qqUÇthe
